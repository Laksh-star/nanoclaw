# Credential Management Skill

Save and reuse browser sessions so Andy can automate tasks on sites you're already logged into.

## How It Works

Two approaches depending on what you have:

| You have | Use |
|----------|-----|
| Nothing yet — want to log in once and save | **Approach A: State save** |
| JSON cookies exported from Cookie-Editor | **Approach B: Cookie injection** |

> **Note:** Netscape format cookies (header says `# Netscape HTTP Cookie File`) are not directly usable. Re-export as JSON from Cookie-Editor, or use Approach A instead.

---

## Approach A: Login Once, Save State (Recommended)

Best when you can log in interactively or the agent can fill the login form.

```bash
# 1. Open the login page
agent-browser open https://godaddy.com/login

# 2. Snapshot to find the login fields
agent-browser snapshot -i

# 3. Fill credentials (or navigate manually if 2FA needed)
agent-browser fill @e1 "your@email.com"
agent-browser fill @e2 "yourpassword"
agent-browser click @e3

# 4. Wait for login to complete
agent-browser wait --url "**/dashboard"

# 5. Save full session state (cookies + localStorage)
agent-browser state save /workspace/group/credentials/sessions/godaddy-session.json
agent-browser close
```

**To reuse later:**
```bash
agent-browser state load /workspace/group/credentials/sessions/godaddy-session.json
agent-browser open https://godaddy.com/dashboard
# Now authenticated — continue with task
```

---

## Approach B: Inject Cookies from JSON Export

Use when you've exported cookies from Cookie-Editor (JSON format).

**Step 1: Save the JSON cookie file**

When user pastes JSON cookies, write them to:
```
/workspace/group/credentials/cookies/<sitename>-cookies.json
```

**Step 2: Open the site first, then inject**

```bash
# Must open the site BEFORE injecting (browser needs a page context)
agent-browser open https://godaddy.com

# Inject all cookies via JavaScript eval
# Read the cookie file and build the eval string:
COOKIES=$(cat /workspace/group/credentials/cookies/godaddy-cookies.json)

agent-browser eval "
  const cookies = $COOKIES;
  cookies.forEach(c => {
    let str = c.name + '=' + encodeURIComponent(c.value);
    if (c.path) str += '; path=' + c.path;
    if (c.secure) str += '; secure';
    document.cookie = str;
  });
  document.cookie.split(';').length + ' cookies set';
"

# Reload to apply cookies
agent-browser reload
agent-browser wait --load networkidle

# Verify you're logged in
agent-browser snapshot -i

# Save state so you don't need to re-inject next time
agent-browser state save /workspace/group/credentials/sessions/godaddy-session.json
agent-browser close
```

> **Why open first?** `eval` runs in the browser's JS context, not Node. The page must be loaded for `document.cookie` to work.

> **Limitation:** `httpOnly` cookies cannot be set via `document.cookie` — they're only sent by the server. If the site uses httpOnly for its auth token, Approach A (state save) is more reliable.

---

## Directory Structure

```
/workspace/group/credentials/
├── cookies/          # Raw JSON cookie exports (temporary — use to bootstrap)
│   └── godaddy-cookies.json
└── sessions/         # Saved browser state (preferred for reuse)
    └── godaddy-session.json
```

Sessions are preferred over raw cookies because they include httpOnly cookies and localStorage.

---

## Commands Reference

```bash
# Save/load full browser state (cookies + localStorage + session)
agent-browser state save /workspace/group/credentials/sessions/<site>-session.json
agent-browser state load /workspace/group/credentials/sessions/<site>-session.json

# Individual cookies
agent-browser cookies                      # List current cookies
agent-browser cookies set name value       # Set a single cookie
agent-browser cookies clear                # Clear all cookies

# JavaScript injection
agent-browser eval "document.cookie = 'name=value; path=/'"
```

## Common Workflows

### First-time setup for a site
```
User: "Set up GoDaddy credentials"
1. Ask: "Do you have JSON cookies from Cookie-Editor, or should I open the login page?"
2. If JSON: Approach B → inject → state save
3. If login page: Approach A → fill form → state save
4. Confirm: "Saved GoDaddy session. Future tasks will load this automatically."
```

### Automated task with saved session
```
User: "Buy bizclaw.io on GoDaddy"
1. Check: credentials/sessions/godaddy-session.json exists? → YES
2. agent-browser state load credentials/sessions/godaddy-session.json
3. agent-browser open https://godaddy.com/domainsearch/find?checkAvail=1&tld=com&domainToCheck=bizclaw.io
4. Proceed with task
5. agent-browser state save credentials/sessions/godaddy-session.json (update state)
```

### Session expired
```
If login fails after loading state (redirected to login page):
1. Inform user: "GoDaddy session expired."
2. Offer: "Should I log in again?" → Approach A
3. Or: "Paste fresh cookies from Cookie-Editor" → Approach B
4. Save updated state
```

### List saved credentials
```bash
echo "=== Sessions ===" && ls -lh /workspace/group/credentials/sessions/ 2>/dev/null || echo "(none)"
echo "=== Cookie files ===" && ls -lh /workspace/group/credentials/cookies/ 2>/dev/null || echo "(none)"
```

### Delete credentials for a site
```bash
rm -f /workspace/group/credentials/sessions/<site>-session.json
rm -f /workspace/group/credentials/cookies/<site>-cookies.json
echo "Deleted <site> credentials"
```

---

## Cookie Export Format (JSON)

Cookie-Editor → Export → **JSON** (not Netscape):

```json
[
  {
    "domain": ".godaddy.com",
    "name": "auth_idp",
    "value": "abc123...",
    "path": "/",
    "expires": 1777689600,
    "httpOnly": true,
    "secure": true,
    "sameSite": "Lax"
  }
]
```

If user gives Netscape format (`# Netscape HTTP Cookie File` header), tell them:
> "Please re-export as JSON from Cookie-Editor: click the export button and choose JSON format, not Netscape."

---

## Security

- Credentials stored in `/workspace/group/credentials/` — local to this group's container mount
- Never log cookie values or session tokens in responses
- Never send cookies to external services
- Warn before automating on: banking, crypto exchanges, medical records
- Delete on user request — don't retain after task if user asks
